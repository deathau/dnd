# Longship

_Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 190_

Longships are vessels that rely on a rowing crew and sails to move across the sea. These ships are typically used to carry soldiers into combat. The size of a longship makes it easy for troops to get on and off quickly, making it the perfect ship for engaging in surprise strikes.

A longship has the following features:

- **Light.** Hanging lanterns cast bright light over the deck.
- **Rigging.** Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.
- **Rudder.** The ship is steered by a rudder control on the aft of the deck.
- **Sails.** The longship has one 20-foot-tall mast with sails that can be used to sail the ship.

## Example Longship Crew

A longship requires a crew of forty to properly sail or row the vessel and often carries extra passengers or soldiers. If the characters are guests on a longship, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:

- One captain ([berserker](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md))
- Five other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, a surgeon, and a cook ([berserkers](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md))
- Thirty-four sailors ([commoners](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md))

## Longship Deck

The deck of the longship has the following features:

- **Oars.** Sixteen benches are built into the deck, each with a 15-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Five spare oars hang on the walls.
- **Railing.** The deck has a 3-foot-high rail covered in wooden shields around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.
